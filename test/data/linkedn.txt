He was the first developer to start working on the React.JS migration and soon enough he became a leader over other passionate React developers, leading his team towards excellence. His impressive skills and motivation really make him stand out. Working with Victor was a great pleasure both because of his impressive development knowledge and his leadership skills. I am happy to have been able to coach him and see him evolve as a fine leader as he is today.
