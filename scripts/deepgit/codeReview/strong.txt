1. Use of clear and concise commit messages: The developer uses straightforward and informative commit messages that explain the changes made in that commit. This makes it easier to understand the history of the project and identify specific changes.

2.

They are also comfortable working with JavaScript features such as asynchronous programming (async/await) and JSON manipulation.

3. Code organization: The developer organizes the code in a logical and systematic manner, breaking down the application into components and using a consistent code style. This makes the code easier to read and maintain.

4. Error handling: The developer incorporates error handling in their commits, which helps to ensure the application can gracefully handle unexpected situations.

5. Security practices: The developer uses tokens for authentication, which is a good security practice.

6. Use of third-party libraries: The developer is comfortable integrating and using third-party libraries (axios, react-alert) in the project, which can speed up the development process and make the code more robust.

7. Attention to user experience: The developer makes changes to improve the user experience, such as updating navigation paths and making minor design changes for better usability.
